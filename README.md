# Nigeria-House-Price-Prediction-
This project focuses on predicting house prices in Nigeria based on key features such as location, number of rooms, house type, and more. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately forecast house prices, providing valuable insights for potential buyers, real estate developers, and investors.

Key highlights:

Data Processing: Cleaned and prepared data for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Created meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance.
Modeling: Applied regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) to predict house prices.
Visualization: Developed an interactive Streamlit web app to showcase house price trends and predictions.
Dashboard: Created a Power BI dashboard for dynamic visualization of house price distribution across regions.
This project demonstrates the power of data in solving real-world problems in the real estate sector.
